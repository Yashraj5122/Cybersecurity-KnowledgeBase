What is Information Disclosure?

Information disclosure occurs when a website unintentionally exposes sensitive data, such as user details, business information, or technical details. Attackers can exploit this by interacting with the site in unexpected ways to gather useful information, potentially leading to further attacks. Even seemingly minor leaks can help attackers discover other vulnerabilities.


Methodology:
1. Access /robots.txt for Subdomain Discovery:

    Check if /robots.txt is accessible to uncover any subdomains or directories excluded from search engine indexing that might contain sensitive information.

2. Parameter Testing for Error Messages:

    Pass various alphanumeric characters to website parameters and analyze the responses for error messages or information leakage that could indicate security vulnerabilities.

3. Subdomain Enumeration with Tools:

    Use tools like FeroxBuster and wordlists (e.g., Seclists) to perform a comprehensive subdomain enumeration for deeper discovery of hidden assets.

4. TRACE Method for Server Behavior Analysis:

    Use the TRACE method to identify inappropriate behavior by inspecting changes in server requests. This can help detect misconfigurations or unauthorized access to restricted pages.

5. Check for Exposed .git Files:

    Look for exposed .git files on websites, as these files may reveal previous version changes, potentially exposing sensitive information or exploitable vulnerabilities.
