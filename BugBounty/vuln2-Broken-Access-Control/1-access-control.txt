What is broken-access-control?

Access control enforces constraints on who can perform actions or access resources, relying on authentication (verifying identity) and session management (tracking user activity).

It determines whether a user is authorized to carry out a requested action.

Broken access controls are common and critical, with human errors and design complexity contributing to security risks.

Note:
Use feroxbuster or any similar domain and subdomain enumeration tool with wordlists like Seclists to get all the existing subdomain names which will be otherwise not known to normal user.

Methodology:

1. Admin Page and Cookie Manipulation:

    Use enumeration tools to locate the admin page. If it’s hidden, use BurpSuite to intercept network traffic and analyze cookies for manipulable parameters, e.g., Admin=False.
    Example: If the cookie shows Admin=False, change it to Admin=True and check for access.

2. User ID Manipulation:

    Identify user IDs from comments or other sources. Modify these in URL parameters to test unauthorized access, using two accounts for validation.
    Example: If User ID 1 has user_id=123, change it to user_id=456 (another user's ID) and see if access is granted.

3. Username Manipulation:

    Check if changing usernames in URL parameters grants access to other users’ data or assets.
    Example: Change username=johndoe to username=janedoe and see if it provides access to Jane’s profile.

4. Data Manipulation:

    Modify data, such as image names, to access restricted or personal files.
    Example: Change an image URL from /images/user123.jpg to /images/user456.jpg to see if you can access another user's image.

5. POST Request Analysis:

    Inspect login POST requests via BurpSuite for leaked parameters (e.g., roleId) that could be exploited for privilege escalation.
    Example: If the server response includes roleId=2, consider manipulating it to roleId=1 to escalate privileges.

6. TRACE Method for Server Behavior Analysis:

    Use the TRACE method to identify inappropriate behavior by inspecting changes in server requests. This can help detect misconfigurations or unauthorized access to restricted pages.
