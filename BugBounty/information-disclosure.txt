What is Information Disclosure?

Information disclosure occurs when a website unintentionally exposes sensitive data, such as user details, business information, or technical details. Attackers can exploit this by interacting with the site in unexpected ways to gather useful information, potentially leading to further attacks. Even seemingly minor leaks can help attackers discover other vulnerabilities.



Methodology:

1. Verify if /robots.txt is accessible to identify any subdomains excluded from indexing.

2. Test website parameters by passing different alphanumeric characters to observe error messages or potential information leakage.

3. Use tools like "FeroxBuster" to enumerate subdomains, utilizing wordlists such as Seclists for comprehensive discovery.

4. Use the TRACE method to check for inappropriate behavior, like restricted admin pages, by analyzing request changes sent to the server. This helps reveal misconfigurations or security issues.

5. Ensure to check for any exposed .git files on websites, as they can reveal changes made in previous versions, potentially exposing sensitive information or vulnerabilities.
